Founded by the guy behind Diapers.com, the company has raised $80 million in investments, and it hasn’t even launched yet. Mid-level employees have joined without knowing exactly how the shopping site will work. A lot of that has to do with the trust both groups have in Jet’s CEO Marc Lore, who previously sold Diapers.com parent company Quidsi to Amazon for about $550 million.</p></div></li><li><img src="/img/content/news/wallstreetjournal.png" width="150" alt="Wall Street Journal"><div class="content-block"><h3><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-diaper-deal-spawns-new-rival-1420679298?KEYWORDS=jet+marc+lore" target="new">Amazon’s Diaper Deal Spawns New Rival</a></h3><p>The co-founder of Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon.com Inc. in 2010, is preparing a new e-commerce site aimed squarely at his former employer.

            <strong>How is Jet different from other retailers?</strong>
            <br/>
            Jet delivers a better way to better prices.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All of our profit comes from membership fees, not the products we sell.
            </li>
            <li>
                We ship smarter and pack better to cut costs, and pass savings back to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                We unbundle costs. We give you the option to avoid costs that are baked into other retailers’ prices.

        <p>
            In other words, we’re the shopping club reinvented to get you the lowest prices on millions of items.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How does Jet’s pricing work?</strong>
            <br/>
            Jet member prices start low, and you have the ability to unlock Bonus Savings as you shop to get even lower prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Member prices automatically serve up savings because:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We ship smarter. We optimize prices based on your zip code: a shorter shipping distance means lower shipping costs.
            </li>
            <li>
                We pack smarter. We match your order to trusted retail partners who can pack your stuff in fewer boxes.
            </li>
            <li>
                We unbundle costs. By taking Bonus Savings actions, you can avoid costs that are baked into other retailers’ prices.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>What are Bonus Savings actions? </strong>
            <br/>
            Bonus Savings actions give you extra savings as you shop.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Smart Cart Bonus: Smart Cart Bonus: Once you start adding items to your cart, we flag products that ship from the same location. Look for items where the
                Smart Cart Bonus is activated to save more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Waive Returns Bonus: Returns create extra shipping costs. Opt out of free returns on items you know you want to keep and save more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Payment Method Bonus: Some payment methods have higher fees than others. Choose one with a lower fee and save more.

            <strong>How does Jet fulfill my order?</strong>

        <p>
            <strong>What does it cost to become a Jet member?</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Will I be automatically enrolled for Jet membership when my free trial or free membership period ends? </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            During your free trial or free membership period, you will accumulate Jet Savings based on your shopping behavior. At the end of your trial, if you have
            already saved the $49.99 cost of membership, you’ll be auto-enrolled for Jet membership using the primary form of payment on your account. If you haven’t
            yet saved the cost of membership, you will be asked if you want to become a paid member after your free trial ends.

            <h3>Shipping</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What is Jet’s shipping policy?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Jet offers free shipping and free returns to all of our members. To qualify for free shipping, your order total before Bonus Savings must be at least $35.
            Free returns must be scanned by your return carrier within 30 days of the item’s initial delivery date<strong>. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Where do my Jet packages ship from?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your Jet orders are delivered either from the warehouses of our trusted retail partners or from our fulfillment centers. Jet selects the retailers that can
            pack and send your shipment in the most efficient, cost-effective way, and that helps determine where your packages are shipped from.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What if I don’t meet the $35 shipping minimum?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For orders under $35, Jet charges a flat shipping fee of $5.99.

        <p>
            <h3>Processing a Return</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How do Jet’s returns work?</strong>
            <br/>
            Jet offers free returns – unless, of course, you choose to ‘waive returns’. All returns and refunds must be scanned by your return carrier within 30 days
            of your item’s initial delivery date. Jet does not offer exchanges. In the event you receive an item in damaged condition, you will be able to return it
            for free even if you had chosen to ‘waive returns’ when you purchased it.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I waived returns on something I bought, but now I want to return it. What do I do?</strong>
            <br/>
            Ah – you have a case of Waiver’s Remorse. That’s okay. Jet will accept items on which you chose to
            ‘waive returns’, but will charge you a Waiver’s Remorse fee to cover our costs. These returns also
            must be scanned by your carrier within 3- days of the item’s initial delivery date.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Are any products non-returnable?</strong>
            <br/>
            Yes. There are some (but not many!) items that cannot be returned. Under no circumstances will Jet accept returns of the following merchandise: hazardous
            items, downloadable software, pay-as-you-go products (phone, games), some jewelry, gift cards, grocery products, flowers &amp; live indoor plants, open
            software, live insects, wine, and items with special shipping instructions imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (as indicated on the product
            detail page). Jet also reserves the right to refuse your return if we receive it outside our 30-day return window, or if the product is used (opened or not
            in its original packaging).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What if I chose “waive return” on an item, but now I want to return it?</strong>
            <br/>
            Jet will happily accept your return, but we’ll charge a return fee to cover the cost of returning the item. In the event you receive an item in damaged
            condition, you will be able to return it for free even if you had chosen to “waive returns.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How do I request a return?</strong>
            <br/>
            Requesting a return is easy. Initiate a return at any time via the Returns Portal on your ‘My Account’ page. You can print your return label directly from
            the site, or, if you prefer, Jet will e-mail it to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How do Jet’s refunds work?</strong>
            <br/>
            We’ll refund the full Jet member price for any given item. The Jet member price is list price, minus any Jet savings you received on the item. You’ll see
            this breakdown at checkout. You can start the refund process by requesting a return via the Returns Portal on your My Account page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>When can I expect to receive a refund?</strong>
            <br/>
            You can expect a full refund within 4-10 days of the date Jet receives your return package.

            <li>
                <strong>Click</strong>
                the link in the Jet Anywhere portal to access one of our 700+ Jet Anywhere stores. JetCash rates are shown in individual merchant descriptions, as well as

                <strong>Shop</strong>

                link, checkout within 24 hours of clicking the link, and make sure that your browser is configured to accept third-party cookies. This maximizes the
                likelihood that Jet can track your purchase correctly.

                With every eligible purchase, you earn JetCash to use on your next Jet order. You’ll see JetCash as a payment method available for use when you check out,
                starting on March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2015, (until then bear with us as we build out this functionality!).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you want to make a second purchase at the same or different eligible merchant, you must first return to the Jet Anywhere portal, repeating the steps
            above.

        <p>
            <strong>The discount comes in the form of JetCash. What exactly IS JetCash?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            JetCash is a reward incentive exclusively available to Jet Members. JetCash issued on eligible purchases can be used to offset the cost of orders placed on
            the Jet sites. Read more about JetCash in our <a href="/#/jet_anywhere_terms">Jet Anywhere Terms</a>.

            <strong>What are the benefits of using Jet Anywhere?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are numerous benefits to shopping with Jet Anywhere, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Access to more products</strong>
                Some of your favorite brands don’t sell on Jet just yet, but we want to give members a way to access these brands at a better price. The Jet Anywhere
                program provides you with savings on 700+ stores across the web. Why shop anywhere else?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deeper discounts. </strong>
                Typical cash-back sites keep a portion of the commission paid to them by online stores before passing savings back to you. At Jet, we’ve chosen a different
                path, passing proceeds on your transaction back to you, just like when you shop from our marketplace.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Consistent savings</strong>
                Jet Anywhere’s store discount offerings are based on percentages that apply to every purchase with no minimum (well, except for a few exclusions in our
                <a href="/#/jet_anywhere_terms">Jet Anywhere Terms</a> that we think are reasonable). The portal isn’t a coupon site or a limited-time offer. Take advantage of our savings all year round!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Earn JetCash for future Jet.com purchases</strong>
                Savings you earn on Jet Anywhere go toward something meaningful – your everyday shopping at Jet.com. Starting on March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2015, your
                JetCash will appear when you check out on Jet.com, so it’s easy to apply your JetCash to your next purchase.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>How does Jet Anywhere actually work?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are able to give you JetCash when you shop Jet Anywhere by eliminating hidden costs in e-commerce. When you click on the links in the Jet Anywhere
            portal and complete an eligible purchase, Jet earns a commission for referring you as a customer. We pass these proceeds back to you in the form of
            JetCash.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What stores are available on Jet Anywhere? </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are over 700 stores in the Jet Anywhere program. Jet has relationships with many stores listed in the Jet Anywhere portal, but there are also many
            others where Jet has simply committed to giving you savings. We invite you to shop all of the Jet Anywhere stores and save. Enjoy!
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Are there limits on Jet Anywhere?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are just a few rules to take note of when using the Jet Anywhere portal.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>JetCash is only available on products.</strong>
                JetCash is generally only earned on the individual item prices/merchandise subtotal of your Eligible Purchases, net of any discounts or coupons used on
                those items. Unless otherwise indicated, JetCash is not earned on taxes, shipping, gift-wrapping, extended warranties, or any other additional fees on
                Eligible Purchases. You may not earn JetCash on the purchase of gift cards, gift certificates or other similar cash equivalents. Also note that the JetCash
                earned may vary with each merchant and product category.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>JetCash applies to online purchases only</strong>
                . Since Jet is focused on innovating the e-commerce landscape, Jet Anywhere only applies to purchases made online through our tracked links.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>JetCash is on merchandise you keep</strong>
                . If Jet learns that you have returned at item for which we awarded JetCash, we reserve the right to reclaim that award in the form of a negative balance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Good things come to those who travel (and wait!)</strong>
                . Any JetCash earned on eligible purchases of travel related items (for example, airfare, hotels and rental cars) will be awarded based on completed travel
                and may be subject to approval delays or require additional verification. Please forward us your purchase confirmation following completion of travel, and
                ensure that your documentation indicates that travel has been completed and paid for.
            </li>
        </ul>

We (at Jet) thank you in advance for your participation in the Jet experience, and are excited that you have chosen to be a part of the Jet “Beta” Phase.</p><p>While Jet is making every effort to make sure the Jet Sites are up the standards we expect when we launch commercially, we note that the Jet Sites are currently a work-in-progress and “under construction”.</p><p>Therefore, during the Jet “Beta” Phase, the following additional terms apply to your use of the Jet Sites:</p><ul><li>You understand you are using the Jet Sites in the Jet “Beta” Phase and agree to keep your Jet experience<div class="underline">confidential,</div>in particular because many aspects of the Jet Sites may change before commercial launch.

When Jet launches commercially, Jet will remove this Section and these terms will no longer be applicable on a going forward basis.</p><p>The below terms of Jet Terms of Use will remain and continue to be effective.</p><p>In these Terms of Use:</p><ul><li>When we say “Jet”, we mean Jet.com, Inc. and any subsidiaries and affiliates of Jet (including any that Jet may form in the future).  At times, we just refer to Jet as “we” and “us” – we hope these Terms of Use reads better when we do that.</li><li>When we say “Jet Sites”, we mean
<a href="http://www.jet.com">www.jet.com</a>, and the other websites and apps operated by Jet that link to these Terms of Use, and include services provided by Jet and the content, activities and transactions they offer or facilitate.</li><li>When we say “Terms of Use”, we mean these Terms of Use and the Service Terms (which is defined below), including for example Jet Membership Terms, Jet Anywhere Terms, and Jet Payment Terms.</li></ul><p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THE JET SITES, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES WITH JET THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION (AND WITH VERY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, NOT IN COURT), AND YOU WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS, AS DETAILED IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15.</p><p>These Terms of Use apply to Jet and the Jet Sites.

Jet reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in any case, you agree to cooperate with Jet if and as requested by Jet in the defense of such matter.</p><h3>13. Applicable Law</h3><p>Any and all disputes, claims and controversies arising out of or relating to the Jet Sites, including the sale or other provision of goods, content, services, or technology on or through the Jet Sites, shall be governed by and construed exclusively in accordance with the laws and decisions of the State of New York applicable to contracts made, entered into and performed entirely therein, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions (except for Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law).  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.</p><h3>14. Disputes/Arbitration</h3><p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</strong></p><p>Jet and you agree that these Terms of Use affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p><p>In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites, Jet or you must give the other notice of the dispute, claim, or controversy, and the notice must include a brief written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, as well as the facts giving rise to the dispute, claim, or controversy and the relief requested.  You must send any such notice to Jet by email to <a href="mailto:legal@jet.com">legal@jet.com</a> AND by U.S. Mail to Jet.com, Inc., Legal Notice, to: (a) prior to May 31, 2015, 353 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair, NJ 07042 and (b) on or after June 1, 2015, 221 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030.
To the extent that Jet has your contact information, it will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail and your email address.  Jet and you will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of dispute, claim, or controversy is sent.  Jet and you shall use reasonable, good faith, efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or controversy through consultation and good faith negotiations.  After 30 days, Jet or you may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30 day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Jet Sites.</p><p>Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind between Jet and you arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites, if unresolved through informal discussions within thirty (30) days of the sending of the notice described above, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Hoboken, New Jersey, and Jet and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in New York, New York to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Jet Sites shall not be subject to arbitration.</p><p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use, and administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and fee information are available at
<a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p><p>Jet shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.  You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including but not limited to attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Jet is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.  For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees.  The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Jet and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Jet and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.  The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jet and you agree not to seek any attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim, defense or other fee- or cost-generating activity was asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or was frivolous.  Jet and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Jet and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  Jet and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p><p>If you or Jet’s claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.&nbsp;</p><p>You or Jet may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Jet otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.</p><p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Jet by email to <a href="mailto:legal@jet.com">legal@jet.com</a> AND by U.S. Mail to Jet.com, Inc., (a) prior to May 31, 2015, 353 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair, NJ 07042 and (b) on or after June 1, 2015, 221 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030.  The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of any of the Jet Sites, and if you have an account on the Jet Sites the notice must be sent from the email address we have on file for that account.  If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.  If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Jet will not be bound by them either.</p><p>If any clause within this Disputes/Arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.  In any event, if for any reason a claim, dispute or controversy between Jet and you is before a court (e.g., if the arbitration provisions are found unenforceable or if pursuant to these Terms of Use the matter is not subject to arbitration), Jet and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.</p><p>This Disputes/Arbitration section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Jet, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites.</p><h3>15. Class Action Waiver</h3><p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p><p>Jet and you agree that Jet and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  Jet and you further agree that Jet and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites.</p><p>If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in New York County, New York.</p><p>This Class Action Waiver section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Jet, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), and/or the Jet Sites, and/or any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites.</p><h3>16. Changes to These Terms of Use</h3><p>Jet may amend these Terms of Use (including any Service Terms) at any time and at Jet’s sole discretion by posting the updated version on
<a href="http://www.jet.com">www.jet.com</a>.  Unless you reject the update as described below, you will be deemed to accept the changes and they will take effect at the earlier of:</p><ul><li>a. 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on the 10th day after posting to
<a href="http://www.jet.com">www.jet.com</a> (if there is no update to the Disputes/Arbitration section) or on the 30th day (if there is an update to the Disputes/Arbitration section); or</li><li>b. your acceptance of them via a click-through process or some other method that we specify.</li></ul><p>To reject the proposed update, you must, by the deadline on the day specified above, both (1) send us an email to
<a href="mailto:rejectingupdate@jet.com">rejectingupdate@jet.com</a> and (2) then click on the verification link in the automated response email we will send you.  You must send this email from the email address we have on file for your account.  The content of the email you send to <a href="mailto:rejectingupdate@jet.com">rejectingupdate@jet.com</a> will have no effect on the Terms of Use and may not be read, and a blank email will suffice to request the verification link.  No other rejection method is valid.</p><p>If you reject the update as described above, then the last version of the Terms of Use to which you and Jet agreed will continue to apply without modification, but then:</p><ul><li>At any time, Jet may in its sole discretion close your account, revoking your access to the Jet Sites or your ability to make purchases on the Jet Sites.  If Jet does so based on your rejection of the update (and not, for example, based on your violation of these Terms of Use), Jet will issue you a prorated refund for unused membership fees as described in the Jet Membership Terms.</li><li>If Jet has not closed your account, Jet reserves the right to propose a further update to the Terms of Use by posting it to www.jet.com.  If you wish, you may accept it (such as by letting the deadline for rejection expire) or reject it as described above.  If you accept it, then the further update will apply to and between you and Jet effective the date of your acceptance.  Rejection will be handled as described in this section.</li><li>If Jet has not closed your account, Jet may choose to condition your use of new or changed features or functionality on the Jet Sites, or your use of a new Jet Site, on your acceptance of the updated Terms of Use, and your use of those features, functionality or Site will constitute your acceptance of the updated Terms effective as of the date of such use.</li></ul><p>In any case, updates to the Terms of Use apply on a going-forward basis as of the date they take effect.</p><h3>Termination by Jet</h3><p>We may close your account at any time in our sole discretion.  In no case will Jet’s closure of your account, or reduction of your access to the Jet Sites waive or affect any other right or relief to which Jet may be entitled.</p><h3>Changes to the Jet Sites</h3><p>We may make frequent changes to the Jet Sites, including changes to the quantity and selection of products sold through the Jet Sites.</p><h3>Additional Terms For Our iOS App</h3><p>You acknowledge and agree that (i) these Terms of Use are concluded between you and Jet only, and Apple is not a party hereto, and (ii) as between Jet and Apple, it is Jet that is responsible for the app and the content thereof.  You must use the iOS app only on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS.  Your use of the app must comply with the terms of use applicable to the Apple source from which you obtain it (including the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service).  You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to furnish you with any maintenance and support services with respect to the app.</p><p>You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the app or your possession and use of the app, including, but not limited to (i) product warranty or liability claims; (ii) any claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; or (iv) claims that the app infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>In the event of any failure of the iOS version of the app to conform to any applicable warranty that has not been effectively disclaimed by these Terms of Use, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the app (if any) to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app, and, as between Apple and Jet, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty of Jet will be Jet’s responsibility, but only to the extent provided by these Terms of Use.  Please read our entire Terms of Use, as other sections of these Terms of Use limit Jet’s liability in this regard.</p><p>Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use with respect to your compliance with this section.  Upon your acceptance of these Terms of Use, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms of Use against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.  There are no other third-party beneficiaries of the Terms.</p><p>Entire Agreement and Admissibility; Applicability to Sellers</p><p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and Jet with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. A printed version of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial, arbitral or administrative proceedings to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p><p>If you access or use the Jet Sites in your capacity as a registered Jet seller (i.e., a retail partner who has registered with Jet to sell products on the Jet Sites), then the Jet Retail Partner Agreement will apply to you in connection with such access and use, not these Terms of Use.  When a Jet retail partner accesses or uses the Jet Sites in any other capacity (e.g., as a Jet Member), these Terms of Use apply and not the Jet Retail Partner Agreement.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><p>You may not assign or otherwise transfer these Terms of Use, by operation of law or otherwise, without Jet’s prior written consent.  Subject to the foregoing restriction, these Terms of Use will be binding on, inure to, and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns.  Jet may assign these Terms of Use in its sole discretion by providing you notice of the same.  For example, Jet may unconditionally assign or otherwise transfer these Terms of Use to any successor in interest, such as an acquirer of a Jet company (via merger, sale of stock, etc.) or a buyer of substantially all of its assets.</p><p>Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of any section.</p><p>Jet’s failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of Jet’s right to enforce such provision or any other provision of these Terms of Use.</p><p>If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the agreement will remain in place, except as explained in the second-to-last paragraphs of the “Disputes/Arbitration” and “Class Action Waiver” sections.</p><h3>How to Contact Us</h3><p>If you have any questions or comments, please contact our Members Services team by:</p><p>(1) emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@jet.com">help@jet.com</a> or</p><p>(2) contacting us by phone at 844-JET-CALL (844-538-2255) or</p><p>(3) mailing us at Jet Help at the following address: (a) prior to May 31, 2015, mail to 353 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair, NJ 07042 and (b) on or after June 1, 2015, mail to 221 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030.</p></div></div></script><script type="text/ng-template" id="views/privacy_policy.html"><div data-jet-nav></div><div id="content_page"><h2>Jet Privacy Notice</h2><p>Last updated: January 7, 2015</p><p>We at Jet know your privacy matters.

They apply to purchases made on the Jet Sites.
These Purchase Terms don’t apply to purchases made on third-party websites through our <strong>Jet Anywhere program.</strong></p><h3>Purchases Generally</h3><p>Only registered Jet Members using their own Jet membership accounts are authorized to make purchases on the Jet Sites.</p><p>The total price required for a purchase on the Jet Sites may depend on a number of factors that may change between the time you start adding items to your cart and the time you submit your purchase request. Items on the Jet Sites have a member price associated with each item. Additionally, savings amounts (“Jet Bonus Savings”) may be applied to the Member price(s) of the item(s) in your cart as you shop. For example, our system may lower or raise the Jet Bonus Savings applied to the item(s) in your cart, according to factors such as (i) the other items present in your cart, (ii) your shipping address, and (iii) your settings and preferences. The types of factors affecting prices may vary frequently. Accordingly, you must review your complete order, including any applicable Jet Bonus Savings (or any other savings amount), the final total purchase price and the final individual item prices, before you submit your purchase request.</p><p>Your submission of a purchase request is an offer by you to purchase the items selected at the prices indicated immediately prior to your submission of the request. This offer remains open until we email you to confirm that it has been accepted or that it has not been accepted (e.g., because an item has become unavailable).   Following acceptance, we will notify you of the identity of the seller(s) that will be selling and fulfilling your order. We cannot confirm the price of an item until after your order is placed. Pricing errors may occur on the Jet Sites. We reserve the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of the order confirmation mentioned above or a shipping notice. We may, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of the cancellation.</p><p>Jet does not currently accept coupons (other than those distributed by Jet).</p><h3>Taxes</h3><p>Items sold on the Jet Sites may be subject to tax. As on other e-commerce sites, prior to submitting your purchase request, you will see an estimate of the tax to be collected. The amount of tax charged on your order will depend on various factors, including the items purchased, the shipment destination, and the identity of the seller(s). Upon acceptance of your order, we will notify you of the identity of the seller(s) that will be selling and fulfilling your order items.</p><p>If Jet is the seller of your item(s), any applicable tax will be applied to the price you pay for items, including any and all Jet Bonus Savings.</p><p>If Jet is not the seller of your item(s), any applicable tax on items will be applied to the price listed for those items by the third party seller, as indicated on the checkout page and/or in the confirmation email sent to you upon order acceptance and/or shipment. In this instance, Jet Bonus Savings will not act to reduce the price on which any applicable tax is applied.</p><h3>Title and Risk of Loss</h3><p>Risk of loss and title of items purchased on the Jet Sites passes to you upon delivery of the items to the common carrier.</p><h3>Returns and Refunds</h3><p>Returns and refunds are available only as described in our
<a href="#/help_faq">Returns/Refund policy.</a></p></div></script><script type="text/ng-template" id="views/membership_terms.html"><div data-jet-nav></div><div id="content_page"><h2>Jet Membership Terms</h2>
<p class="p2">Last update posted:&nbsp; January 7, 2015</p>
<p class="p2">Jet is excited that you are now a Jet Member!&nbsp; And, here are the Jet Membership Terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">These Jet Membership Terms are part of the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>.&nbsp;
    (Please click on and read the Jet Terms of Use, they contain important legal information about your membership terms, and you are bound both by these Jet Membership Terms and the Jet Terms of Use.)</p>
<h3>Jet Membership</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You must be a Jet Member to make purchases on our Jet Sites.</li>
    <li>Each Jet Membership is personal to that Jet Member and limited to use by you and your household. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not purchase items for resale or rental. &nbsp; You can purchase items for personal use, and you can also purchase items for your business, like office supplies, but not for commercial resale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership Fees</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Jet membership fee is paid in advance for your membership term.&nbsp; Taxes may apply on the Jet membership fee.</li>
    <li>We may offer free memberships that are valid for some period of time (or for some number of purchases) (&ldquo;<strong>Trial Membership</strong>&rdquo;).&nbsp; If you have a Trial Membership, the term begins when you sign up for the membership, except where the trial offer specifies otherwise.&nbsp; After your Trial Membership expires or terminates, you will then be asked to pay for your membership to continue shopping on Jet.</li>
    <li>You cannot combine Trial Memberships - without Jet&rsquo;s express written consent.&nbsp; So, if you have a 3 month Trial Membership, then you can&rsquo;t use another 3 month Trial Membership (unless that Trial Membership explicitly says that you can).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership Savings Guarantee / Terminating Your Membership</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We hope you never want to stop being a Jet Member.&nbsp; But, you may cancel your membership any time by following the instructions indicated on the <a href="/#/profile">Your Account</a> page.</li>
    <li><strong>Membership Savings Guarantee</strong>. &nbsp; If you cancel your paid annual membership and you have not realized Jet bonus savings greater than your current annual membership fee, we will refund you the difference.
        To do so, follow the instructions on the <a href="/#/profile">Your Account</a> page.
        <ul>
            <li>This guarantee applies only to memberships where you have paid the membership fee.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Also, if you cancel a paid membership within 3 business days of signing up for it, or within 3 business days of converting from a free trial to a paid membership, we will refund your full membership fee, provided that you haven&rsquo;t yet placed an order on Jet or otherwise used your paid membership. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Membership fees are otherwise nonrefundable, except as described in the Termination by Jet section of the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a>. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership Renewals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A paid annual membership is set to automatically renew for another year, unless you opt out of renewal or cancel your membership prior to that renewal date. Upon renewal, you authorize us to charge the membership rate (and any applicable taxes) in effect at the time of renewal to any payment card that we then have on file for you. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Jet reserves the right to terminate your Jet membership and close your account at any time in our sole discretion, without advance notice.&nbsp;
    If we do, you are generally eligible for the membership savings guarantee described above.&nbsp; However, for the administrative burden of terminating your membership,
    Jet will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion,
    violates our Terms of Use.&nbsp; Please see the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>
    for more information.</p></div></script><script type="text/ng-template" id="views/jet_anywhere_terms.html"><div data-jet-nav></div><div id="content_page"><h2>Jet Anywhere Terms</h2>
<p class="p2">Last update posted:&nbsp; January 7, 2015</p>
<p class="p2">These Jet Anywhere Terms are part of the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>, and they only apply to our Jet Anywhere program.&nbsp; These terms contain important limits and conditions dealing with the Jet Anywhere program.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Purchases made on the other Jet sites are governed instead by our <a href="/#/purchase_terms"><strong>Jet Purchase Terms</strong></a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><u>No relationship with merchants on Jet Anywhere</u></strong><strong>:&nbsp; Many merchants included on Jet Anywhere are </strong><strong>not</strong><strong> affiliated with Jet, and these merchants (and their brands) have </strong><strong>not</strong><strong> endorsed or sponsored Jet Anywhere.&nbsp; The names and logos listed on Jet Anywhere are owned or controlled by the merchants where you make the Eligible Purchases, and are </strong><strong>not</strong><strong> licensed or owned by Jet.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How to use Jet Anywhere</strong></p>
<p class="p2">You must be a Jet member to use Jet Anywhere.&nbsp; Sign up for a Jet membership <a href="https://jet.com/#/gate"><strong>here</strong></a>.&nbsp;
    Once you have a Jet membership, visit the <a href="https://www.jet.com/#/anywhere">Jet Anywhere portal</a> to view the list of eligible merchants.
    Visiting this portal and clicking on the links to eligible merchant websites prior to shopping allows you to earn JetCash by making Eligible Purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How to make Eligible Purchases on Jet Anywhere</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>&ldquo;Eligible Purchases&rdquo; </strong>are purchases you make on Jet Anywhere where you are eligible to receive JetCash.&nbsp;
    Making Eligible Purchases is easy: Follow the <a href="https://jet.com/#/help_faq#anywhere"><strong>step by step instructions</strong></a> on the Jet Anywhere portal to make your Eligible Purchases. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Failure to follow the instructions may result in no JetCash being earned.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>What is JetCash?</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&ldquo;<strong>JetCash</strong>&rdquo; is a reward incentive exclusively available to Jet Members that is issued on Eligible Purchases.&nbsp; JetCash is added to your Jet Membership account and can be used to offset the cost of orders placed on www.jet.com. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>JetCash is issued for promotional purposes, has no intrinsic value and may not be redeemed for cash.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How much JetCash can I receive on an Eligible Purchase?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Specific JetCash amounts that you may earn on Eligible Purchases vary by merchant and product category.&nbsp; Visit the <a href="https://www.jet.com/#/anywhere"><strong>Jet Anywhere portal</strong></a> for specific JetCash amounts (and any other qualifications) relating to any specific Eligible Purchase.&nbsp; Jet reserves the right to change the list of eligible merchants, JetCash amounts, or qualifications at any time.</p>
<p class="p2">While we try to ensure that our Jet Anywhere portal&rsquo;s descriptions and calculations of JetCash that can be earned are accurate and complete, this information may sometimes be out of date (for example, if a merchant changes its policies or if there is a human error).&nbsp; Jet will not be responsible for inaccuracies or errors on Jet Anywhere and reserves the right to modify any JetCash amounts that result from these inaccuracies or errors. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">JetCash is generally only earned on the individual item prices/merchandise subtotal of your Eligible Purchases, net of any discounts or coupons used on those items.&nbsp; Unless otherwise indicated, JetCash is not earned on taxes, shipping, gift-wrapping, extended warranties, or any other additional fees on Eligible Purchases. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>When will I receive JetCash? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">We will typically issue JetCash into your Jet Member account within three (3) business days after you forward your purchase confirmation email to <a href="mailto:anywhere@jet.com">anywhere@jet.com</a>.&nbsp; However, read below for exceptions to when Jet will issue JetCash to your account.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Redeeming JetCash&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">You will have the option to apply any available JetCash in your Jet membership account to purchases you make on www.jet.com as part of your Jet membership.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Expiration of JetCash</strong></p>
<p class="p2">You must have an active Jet membership to use JetCash, and as long as you remain a Jet member, your JetCash does not expire.&nbsp; Any unused JetCash expires after six (6) months of membership inactivity, except where prohibited by applicable law.&nbsp; If your Jet membership expires before you use or receive your full balance of JetCash, we will hold the JetCash for you so that you can use it the next time you have an active Jet membership, subject to the six month expiration period referred to above. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>When is a purchase not an &ldquo;Eligible Purchase&rdquo;?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Eligible Purchases are modified or disqualified by the below conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Because the Jet Anywhere program is inspired by our desire to pass through extra savings, through referral fees, to you, a purchase is only an Eligible Purchase if the eligible merchant eventually pays Jet a referral fee applicable to that purchase.&nbsp; The decision to pay us a referral fee, and the exact amount of the referral fee, are in the merchant&rsquo;s discretion. Accordingly, we reserve the right to not issue JetCash if we do not receive a referral fee for your Eligible Purchase. The best way to ensure that a purchase is deemed eligible is to follow the steps outlined in the FAQ. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on the purchase of gift cards, gift certificates or other similar cash equivalents.</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases where a gift card, gift certificate or other similar instrument (such a loyalty points) is used as a payment method, unless a merchant specifically states otherwise. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases of items for resale or rental.</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on the purchase of collectible items that have a readily available trading market, such as coins, stamps, sports collectibles or similar items as determined by Jet in our sole discretion.</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on orders shipped outside of the United States. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases made with merchants that are not listed on the Jet Anywhere portal at the time the Eligible Purchase is made. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases made using offline channels (for example, in store purchases). &nbsp;</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to delay or deny the issuance of JetCash for any reason in our sole discretion. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">Additionally, Jet will not issue JetCash to your account (or if issued, may be voided) if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We learn that the purchased item for which JetCash was earned has been returned.</li>
    <li>We believe the Eligible Purchase or corresponding referral fee may be the result of activity that is fraudulent, unlawful, or otherwise in violation of our Terms of Use or the relevant merchant&rsquo;s requirements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Additionally, Jet reserves the right to void or revoke our previous issuance of any JetCash for any of the reasons explained above (for example, if you return an Eligible Purchase to the merchant or if you participate in resale activities).</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Rules that apply to travel purchases</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Any JetCash earned on Eligible Purchases of travel related items (including but not limited to, airfare, hotels and rental cars) will be awarded based on completed travel and may be subject to approval delays or require additional verification.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Limits to your Jet Anywhere account&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Your Jet account can earn a maximum of $1,000 in JetCash in any given calendar year (January 1 to December 31).&nbsp; We will process Eligible Purchases and issue the relevant JetCash to your account up to that maximum amount.&nbsp; Any Eligible Purchases processed after that annual amount is reached during any calendar year will be deemed ineligible in the current year and will not carryover to the next year. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>No transfer of JetCash</strong></p>
<p class="p2">JetCash is nontransferable and not assignable under any circumstances.&nbsp; Jet reserves the right to impose additional rules or to monitor accounts to enforce this provision.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>We are us, and they are them, and related legalese</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Jet is not a party to your transactions with eligible merchants, regardless of whether your purchase qualifies as an Eligible Purchase. &nbsp; Jet is not the seller or supplier of any of the goods or services these merchants make available through Jet Anywhere.&nbsp; Jet does not endorse or make any promises regarding the merchants or their goods and services.&nbsp; We have none of the legal obligations that may apply to the sellers or suppliers of the merchant&rsquo;s goods or services.&nbsp; We have no control over or responsibility for:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>the quality, safety or legality of the goods or services available from any eligible merchant,&nbsp;</li>
    <li>whether the merchant will complete any transaction, or&nbsp;</li>
    <li>whether the merchant will comply with its own terms and legal obligations. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><strong>We may have no relationship with the eligible merchant, or we may work with them only via an intermediary. </strong>You should exercise no lesser degree of caution in entering into a transaction with eligible merchants via Jet Anywhere than you would when entering into the same or similar transactions through any other means without Jet Anywhere. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">If something goes wrong with your purchase, you must take it up directly with the merchant, not Jet.&nbsp; Between you and the merchant, your purchase will be subject to the merchant&rsquo;s own terms and conditions, and Jet isn&rsquo;t obligated by the merchant&rsquo;s terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">However, your participation in the Jet Anywhere program and any dispute that arises between you and Jet relating to Jet Anywhere is subject to the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>, including these Jet Anywhere Terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last Updated: January 7, 2015</p>
<p class="underline"><strong>Temporary terms applicable to the Jet Sites only during the Jet “Beta” Phase:</strong></p>
<p>You have entered the Jet Sites during Jet’s testing (i.e., “Beta”) phase (which we’re calling the “Jet ‘Beta’ Phase”) through special access given only to a select group of people, such as friends and family.  During the Jet “Beta” Phase, we are providing you with special, early access to the Jet Sites so you can both be an early shopper on Jet and, more importantly, provide Jet with feedback.  We (at Jet) thank you in advance for your participation in the Jet experience, and are excited that you have chosen to be a part of the Jet “Beta” Phase.</p><p>While Jet is making every effort to make sure the Jet Sites are up the standards we expect when we launch commercially, we note that the Jet Sites are currently a work-in-progress and “under construction”.</p><p>Therefore, during the Jet “Beta” Phase, the following additional terms apply to your use of the Jet Sites:</p><ul><li>You understand you are using the Jet Sites in the Jet “Beta” Phase and agree to keep your Jet experience<div class="underline">confidential,</div>in particular because many aspects of the Jet Sites may change before commercial launch.  (That means no tweets or Facebook posts (or other public comments) until we launch!)</li><li>Given the Jet “Beta” Phase, Jet may shut down or close your Jet account at any time for any reason (such as, for example, modifications to the Jet Sites).</li><li>Jet encourages and hopes that you will provide a lot of suggestions, comments, ideas, improvements or other feedback about the Jet Sites, and you agree that Jet will be free to use and will own all rights in this feedback and any changes that come from this feedback.</li><li>Jet may amend these Terms of Use (including any Service Terms) at any time and at Jet’s sole discretion by posting the updated version on
<a href="http://www.jet.com">www.jet.com</a> as set forth in Section 16 of these Terms of Use.

When Jet launches commercially, Jet will remove this Section and these terms will no longer be applicable on a going forward basis.</p><p>The below terms of Jet Terms of Use will remain and continue to be effective.</p><p>In these Terms of Use:</p><ul><li>When we say “Jet”, we mean Jet.com, Inc. and any subsidiaries and affiliates of Jet (including any that Jet may form in the future).  At times, we just refer to Jet as “we” and “us” – we hope these Terms of Use reads better when we do that.</li><li>When we say “Jet Sites”, we mean
<a href="http://www.jet.com">www.jet.com</a>, and the other websites and apps operated by Jet that link to these Terms of Use, and include services provided by Jet and the content, activities and transactions they offer or facilitate.</li><li>When we say “Terms of Use”, we mean these Terms of Use and the Service Terms (which is defined below), including for example Jet Membership Terms, Jet Anywhere Terms, and Jet Payment Terms.</li></ul><p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THE JET SITES, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES WITH JET THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION (AND WITH VERY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, NOT IN COURT), AND YOU WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS, AS DETAILED IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15.</p><p>These Terms of Use apply to Jet and the Jet Sites.  These Terms of Use govern your use of the Jet Sites and your relationship with Jet in connection with the Jet Sites.&nbsp;</p><p>By accessing or otherwise using any of the Jet Sites, clicking to accept these Terms of Use, or accepting these Terms of Use through any other method we specify, you agree to these Terms of Use.&nbsp; If you violate or do not agree to these Terms of Use, your access to and other use of the Jet Sites is unauthorized.</p><p>These Terms of Use contain many important points, including important warranty disclaimers and limitations on Jet’s liability, including as explained in sections 10 and 11; and an explanation of how these Terms of Use will be updated, as detailed in section 16.</p><h3>1.

You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including but not limited to attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Jet is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.  For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees.  The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Jet and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Jet and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.  The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jet and you agree not to seek any attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim, defense or other fee- or cost-generating activity was asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or was frivolous.  Jet and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Jet and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  Jet and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p><p>If you or Jet’s claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.&nbsp;</p><p>You or Jet may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Jet otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.</p><p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Jet by email to <a href="mailto:legal@jet.com">legal@jet.com</a> AND by U.S. Mail to Jet.com, Inc., (a) prior to May 31, 2015, 353 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair, NJ 07042 and (b) on or after June 1, 2015, 221 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030.  The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of any of the Jet Sites, and if you have an account on the Jet Sites the notice must be sent from the email address we have on file for that account.  If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.  If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Jet will not be bound by them either.</p><p>If any clause within this Disputes/Arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.  In any event, if for any reason a claim, dispute or controversy between Jet and you is before a court (e.g., if the arbitration provisions are found unenforceable or if pursuant to these Terms of Use the matter is not subject to arbitration), Jet and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.</p><p>This Disputes/Arbitration section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Jet, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites.</p><h3>15. Class Action Waiver</h3><p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p><p>Jet and you agree that Jet and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  Jet and you further agree that Jet and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Jet Sites, any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites.</p><p>If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in New York County, New York.</p><p>This Class Action Waiver section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Jet, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Terms of Use (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), and/or the Jet Sites, and/or any person’s access to and/or use of the Jet Sites, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Jet Sites.</p><h3>16. Changes to These Terms of Use</h3><p>Jet may amend these Terms of Use (including any Service Terms) at any time and at Jet’s sole discretion by posting the updated version on
<a href="http://www.jet.com">www.jet.com</a>.  Unless you reject the update as described below, you will be deemed to accept the changes and they will take effect at the earlier of:</p><ul><li>a. 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on the 10th day after posting to
<a href="http://www.jet.com">www.jet.com</a> (if there is no update to the Disputes/Arbitration section) or on the 30th day (if there is an update to the Disputes/Arbitration section); or</li><li>b. your acceptance of them via a click-through process or some other method that we specify.</li></ul><p>To reject the proposed update, you must, by the deadline on the day specified above, both (1) send us an email to
<a href="mailto:rejectingupdate@jet.com">rejectingupdate@jet.com</a> and (2) then click on the verification link in the automated response email we will send you.  You must send this email from the email address we have on file for your account.  The content of the email you send to <a href="mailto:rejectingupdate@jet.com">rejectingupdate@jet.com</a> will have no effect on the Terms of Use and may not be read, and a blank email will suffice to request the verification link.  No other rejection method is valid.</p><p>If you reject the update as described above, then the last version of the Terms of Use to which you and Jet agreed will continue to apply without modification, but then:</p><ul><li>At any time, Jet may in its sole discretion close your account, revoking your access to the Jet Sites or your ability to make purchases on the Jet Sites.  If Jet does so based on your rejection of the update (and not, for example, based on your violation of these Terms of Use), Jet will issue you a prorated refund for unused membership fees as described in the Jet Membership Terms.</li><li>If Jet has not closed your account, Jet reserves the right to propose a further update to the Terms of Use by posting it to www.jet.com.  If you wish, you may accept it (such as by letting the deadline for rejection expire) or reject it as described above.  If you accept it, then the further update will apply to and between you and Jet effective the date of your acceptance.  Rejection will be handled as described in this section.</li><li>If Jet has not closed your account, Jet may choose to condition your use of new or changed features or functionality on the Jet Sites, or your use of a new Jet Site, on your acceptance of the updated Terms of Use, and your use of those features, functionality or Site will constitute your acceptance of the updated Terms effective as of the date of such use.</li></ul><p>In any case, updates to the Terms of Use apply on a going-forward basis as of the date they take effect.</p><h3>Termination by Jet</h3><p>We may close your account at any time in our sole discretion.  In no case will Jet’s closure of your account, or reduction of your access to the Jet Sites waive or affect any other right or relief to which Jet may be entitled.</p><h3>Changes to the Jet Sites</h3><p>We may make frequent changes to the Jet Sites, including changes to the quantity and selection of products sold through the Jet Sites.</p><h3>Additional Terms For Our iOS App</h3><p>You acknowledge and agree that (i) these Terms of Use are concluded between you and Jet only, and Apple is not a party hereto, and (ii) as between Jet and Apple, it is Jet that is responsible for the app and the content thereof.  You must use the iOS app only on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS.  Your use of the app must comply with the terms of use applicable to the Apple source from which you obtain it (including the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service).  You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to furnish you with any maintenance and support services with respect to the app.</p><p>You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the app or your possession and use of the app, including, but not limited to (i) product warranty or liability claims; (ii) any claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; or (iv) claims that the app infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights.</p><p>In the event of any failure of the iOS version of the app to conform to any applicable warranty that has not been effectively disclaimed by these Terms of Use, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the app (if any) to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app, and, as between Apple and Jet, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty of Jet will be Jet’s responsibility, but only to the extent provided by these Terms of Use.  Please read our entire Terms of Use, as other sections of these Terms of Use limit Jet’s liability in this regard.</p><p>Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use with respect to your compliance with this section.  Upon your acceptance of these Terms of Use, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms of Use against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.  There are no other third-party beneficiaries of the Terms.</p><p>Entire Agreement and Admissibility; Applicability to Sellers</p><p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and Jet with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. A printed version of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial, arbitral or administrative proceedings to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p><p>If you access or use the Jet Sites in your capacity as a registered Jet seller (i.e., a retail partner who has registered with Jet to sell products on the Jet Sites), then the Jet Retail Partner Agreement will apply to you in connection with such access and use, not these Terms of Use.  When a Jet retail partner accesses or uses the Jet Sites in any other capacity (e.g., as a Jet Member), these Terms of Use apply and not the Jet Retail Partner Agreement.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><p>You may not assign or otherwise transfer these Terms of Use, by operation of law or otherwise, without Jet’s prior written consent.  Subject to the foregoing restriction, these Terms of Use will be binding on, inure to, and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns.  Jet may assign these Terms of Use in its sole discretion by providing you notice of the same.  For example, Jet may unconditionally assign or otherwise transfer these Terms of Use to any successor in interest, such as an acquirer of a Jet company (via merger, sale of stock, etc.) or a buyer of substantially all of its assets.</p><p>Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of any section.</p><p>Jet’s failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of Jet’s right to enforce such provision or any other provision of these Terms of Use.</p><p>If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the agreement will remain in place, except as explained in the second-to-last paragraphs of the “Disputes/Arbitration” and “Class Action Waiver” sections.</p><h3>How to Contact Us</h3><p>If you have any questions or comments, please contact our Members Services team by:</p><p>(1) emailing us at <a href="mailto:help@jet.com">help@jet.com</a> or</p><p>(2) contacting us by phone at 844-JET-CALL (844-538-2255) or</p><p>(3) mailing us at Jet Help at the following address: (a) prior to May 31, 2015, mail to 353 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair, NJ 07042 and (b) on or after June 1, 2015, mail to 221 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030.</p></div><a href class="close-button">Got it</a></div></div></script><script type="text/ng-template" id="views/membership-terms-modal.html"><div id="insider_info_container"><div class="clearfix"><a href class="close"></a></div><div id="content_page"><h2>Jet Membership Terms</h2>
<p class="p2">Last update posted:&nbsp; January 7, 2015</p>
<p class="p2">Jet is excited that you are now a Jet Member!&nbsp; And, here are the Jet Membership Terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">These Jet Membership Terms are part of the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>.&nbsp;
    (Please click on and read the Jet Terms of Use, they contain important legal information about your membership terms, and you are bound both by these Jet Membership Terms and the Jet Terms of Use.)</p>
<h3>Jet Membership</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You must be a Jet Member to make purchases on our Jet Sites.</li>
    <li>Each Jet Membership is personal to that Jet Member and limited to use by you and your household. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not purchase items for resale or rental. &nbsp; You can purchase items for personal use, and you can also purchase items for your business, like office supplies, but not for commercial resale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership Fees</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Jet membership fee is paid in advance for your membership term.&nbsp; Taxes may apply on the Jet membership fee.</li>
    <li>We may offer free memberships that are valid for some period of time (or for some number of purchases) (&ldquo;<strong>Trial Membership</strong>&rdquo;).&nbsp; If you have a Trial Membership, the term begins when you sign up for the membership, except where the trial offer specifies otherwise.&nbsp; After your Trial Membership expires or terminates, you will then be asked to pay for your membership to continue shopping on Jet.</li>
    <li>You cannot combine Trial Memberships - without Jet&rsquo;s express written consent.&nbsp; So, if you have a 3 month Trial Membership, then you can&rsquo;t use another 3 month Trial Membership (unless that Trial Membership explicitly says that you can).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership Savings Guarantee / Terminating Your Membership</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We hope you never want to stop being a Jet Member.&nbsp; But, you may cancel your membership any time by following the instructions indicated on the <a href="/#/profile">Your Account</a> page.</li>
    <li><strong>Membership Savings Guarantee</strong>. &nbsp; If you cancel your paid annual membership and you have not realized Jet bonus savings greater than your current annual membership fee, we will refund you the difference.
        To do so, follow the instructions on the <a href="/#/profile">Your Account</a> page.
        <ul>
            <li>This guarantee applies only to memberships where you have paid the membership fee.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Also, if you cancel a paid membership within 3 business days of signing up for it, or within 3 business days of converting from a free trial to a paid membership, we will refund your full membership fee, provided that you haven&rsquo;t yet placed an order on Jet or otherwise used your paid membership. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Membership fees are otherwise nonrefundable, except as described in the Termination by Jet section of the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a>. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Membership Renewals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A paid annual membership is set to automatically renew for another year, unless you opt out of renewal or cancel your membership prior to that renewal date. Upon renewal, you authorize us to charge the membership rate (and any applicable taxes) in effect at the time of renewal to any payment card that we then have on file for you. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Jet reserves the right to terminate your Jet membership and close your account at any time in our sole discretion, without advance notice.&nbsp;
    If we do, you are generally eligible for the membership savings guarantee described above.&nbsp; However, for the administrative burden of terminating your membership,
    Jet will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion,
    violates our Terms of Use.&nbsp; Please see the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>
    for more information.</p><a href class="close-button">Got it</a></div></div></script><script type="text/ng-template" id="views/anywhere-terms-modal.html"><div id="insider_info_container"><div class="clearfix"><a href class="close"></a></div><div id="content_page"><h2>Jet Anywhere Terms</h2>
<p class="p2">Last update posted:&nbsp; January 7, 2015</p>
<p class="p2">These Jet Anywhere Terms are part of the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>, and they only apply to our Jet Anywhere program.&nbsp; These terms contain important limits and conditions dealing with the Jet Anywhere program.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Purchases made on the other Jet sites are governed instead by our <a href="/#/purchase_terms"><strong>Jet Purchase Terms</strong></a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><u>No relationship with merchants on Jet Anywhere</u></strong><strong>:&nbsp; Many merchants included on Jet Anywhere are </strong><strong>not</strong><strong> affiliated with Jet, and these merchants (and their brands) have </strong><strong>not</strong><strong> endorsed or sponsored Jet Anywhere.&nbsp; The names and logos listed on Jet Anywhere are owned or controlled by the merchants where you make the Eligible Purchases, and are </strong><strong>not</strong><strong> licensed or owned by Jet.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How to use Jet Anywhere</strong></p>
<p class="p2">You must be a Jet member to use Jet Anywhere.&nbsp; Sign up for a Jet membership <a href="https://jet.com/#/gate"><strong>here</strong></a>.&nbsp;
    Once you have a Jet membership, visit the <a href="https://www.jet.com/#/anywhere">Jet Anywhere portal</a> to view the list of eligible merchants.
    Visiting this portal and clicking on the links to eligible merchant websites prior to shopping allows you to earn JetCash by making Eligible Purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How to make Eligible Purchases on Jet Anywhere</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>&ldquo;Eligible Purchases&rdquo; </strong>are purchases you make on Jet Anywhere where you are eligible to receive JetCash.&nbsp;
    Making Eligible Purchases is easy: Follow the <a href="https://jet.com/#/help_faq#anywhere"><strong>step by step instructions</strong></a> on the Jet Anywhere portal to make your Eligible Purchases. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Failure to follow the instructions may result in no JetCash being earned.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>What is JetCash?</strong></p>
<p class="p2">&ldquo;<strong>JetCash</strong>&rdquo; is a reward incentive exclusively available to Jet Members that is issued on Eligible Purchases.&nbsp; JetCash is added to your Jet Membership account and can be used to offset the cost of orders placed on www.jet.com. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>JetCash is issued for promotional purposes, has no intrinsic value and may not be redeemed for cash.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>How much JetCash can I receive on an Eligible Purchase?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Specific JetCash amounts that you may earn on Eligible Purchases vary by merchant and product category.&nbsp; Visit the <a href="https://www.jet.com/#/anywhere"><strong>Jet Anywhere portal</strong></a> for specific JetCash amounts (and any other qualifications) relating to any specific Eligible Purchase.&nbsp; Jet reserves the right to change the list of eligible merchants, JetCash amounts, or qualifications at any time.</p>
<p class="p2">While we try to ensure that our Jet Anywhere portal&rsquo;s descriptions and calculations of JetCash that can be earned are accurate and complete, this information may sometimes be out of date (for example, if a merchant changes its policies or if there is a human error).&nbsp; Jet will not be responsible for inaccuracies or errors on Jet Anywhere and reserves the right to modify any JetCash amounts that result from these inaccuracies or errors. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">JetCash is generally only earned on the individual item prices/merchandise subtotal of your Eligible Purchases, net of any discounts or coupons used on those items.&nbsp; Unless otherwise indicated, JetCash is not earned on taxes, shipping, gift-wrapping, extended warranties, or any other additional fees on Eligible Purchases. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>When will I receive JetCash? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">We will typically issue JetCash into your Jet Member account within three (3) business days after you forward your purchase confirmation email to <a href="mailto:anywhere@jet.com">anywhere@jet.com</a>.&nbsp; However, read below for exceptions to when Jet will issue JetCash to your account.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Redeeming JetCash&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">You will have the option to apply any available JetCash in your Jet membership account to purchases you make on www.jet.com as part of your Jet membership.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Expiration of JetCash</strong></p>
<p class="p2">You must have an active Jet membership to use JetCash, and as long as you remain a Jet member, your JetCash does not expire.&nbsp; Any unused JetCash expires after six (6) months of membership inactivity, except where prohibited by applicable law.&nbsp; If your Jet membership expires before you use or receive your full balance of JetCash, we will hold the JetCash for you so that you can use it the next time you have an active Jet membership, subject to the six month expiration period referred to above. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>When is a purchase not an &ldquo;Eligible Purchase&rdquo;?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Eligible Purchases are modified or disqualified by the below conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Because the Jet Anywhere program is inspired by our desire to pass through extra savings, through referral fees, to you, a purchase is only an Eligible Purchase if the eligible merchant eventually pays Jet a referral fee applicable to that purchase.&nbsp; The decision to pay us a referral fee, and the exact amount of the referral fee, are in the merchant&rsquo;s discretion. Accordingly, we reserve the right to not issue JetCash if we do not receive a referral fee for your Eligible Purchase. The best way to ensure that a purchase is deemed eligible is to follow the steps outlined in the FAQ. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on the purchase of gift cards, gift certificates or other similar cash equivalents.</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases where a gift card, gift certificate or other similar instrument (such a loyalty points) is used as a payment method, unless a merchant specifically states otherwise. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases of items for resale or rental.</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on the purchase of collectible items that have a readily available trading market, such as coins, stamps, sports collectibles or similar items as determined by Jet in our sole discretion.</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on orders shipped outside of the United States. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases made with merchants that are not listed on the Jet Anywhere portal at the time the Eligible Purchase is made. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>You may not earn JetCash on purchases made using offline channels (for example, in store purchases). &nbsp;</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to delay or deny the issuance of JetCash for any reason in our sole discretion. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">Additionally, Jet will not issue JetCash to your account (or if issued, may be voided) if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We learn that the purchased item for which JetCash was earned has been returned.</li>
    <li>We believe the Eligible Purchase or corresponding referral fee may be the result of activity that is fraudulent, unlawful, or otherwise in violation of our Terms of Use or the relevant merchant&rsquo;s requirements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Additionally, Jet reserves the right to void or revoke our previous issuance of any JetCash for any of the reasons explained above (for example, if you return an Eligible Purchase to the merchant or if you participate in resale activities).</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Rules that apply to travel purchases</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Any JetCash earned on Eligible Purchases of travel related items (including but not limited to, airfare, hotels and rental cars) will be awarded based on completed travel and may be subject to approval delays or require additional verification.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Limits to your Jet Anywhere account&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Your Jet account can earn a maximum of $1,000 in JetCash in any given calendar year (January 1 to December 31).&nbsp; We will process Eligible Purchases and issue the relevant JetCash to your account up to that maximum amount.&nbsp; Any Eligible Purchases processed after that annual amount is reached during any calendar year will be deemed ineligible in the current year and will not carryover to the next year. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>No transfer of JetCash</strong></p>
<p class="p2">JetCash is nontransferable and not assignable under any circumstances.&nbsp; Jet reserves the right to impose additional rules or to monitor accounts to enforce this provision.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>We are us, and they are them, and related legalese</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Jet is not a party to your transactions with eligible merchants, regardless of whether your purchase qualifies as an Eligible Purchase. &nbsp; Jet is not the seller or supplier of any of the goods or services these merchants make available through Jet Anywhere.&nbsp; Jet does not endorse or make any promises regarding the merchants or their goods and services.&nbsp; We have none of the legal obligations that may apply to the sellers or suppliers of the merchant&rsquo;s goods or services.&nbsp; We have no control over or responsibility for:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>the quality, safety or legality of the goods or services available from any eligible merchant,&nbsp;</li>
    <li>whether the merchant will complete any transaction, or&nbsp;</li>
    <li>whether the merchant will comply with its own terms and legal obligations. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><strong>We may have no relationship with the eligible merchant, or we may work with them only via an intermediary. </strong>You should exercise no lesser degree of caution in entering into a transaction with eligible merchants via Jet Anywhere than you would when entering into the same or similar transactions through any other means without Jet Anywhere. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">If something goes wrong with your purchase, you must take it up directly with the merchant, not Jet.&nbsp; Between you and the merchant, your purchase will be subject to the merchant&rsquo;s own terms and conditions, and Jet isn&rsquo;t obligated by the merchant&rsquo;s terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">However, your participation in the Jet Anywhere program and any dispute that arises between you and Jet relating to Jet Anywhere is subject to the <a href="/#/terms_of_use"><strong>Jet Terms of Use</strong></a>, including these Jet Anywhere Terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">For questions about Jet Anywhere, please contact <a href="mailto:anywhere@jet.com">anywhere@jet.com</a>.</p><a href class="close-button">Got it</a></div></div></script><script type="text/ng-template" id="views/purchase-terms-modal.html"><div id="insider_info_container"><div class="clearfix"><a href class="close"></a></div><div id="content_page"><h2>Purchase Terms</h2><p>Last updated: January 7, 2015</p><p>These Purchase Terms are part of the <a href="/#/terms_of_use">Jet Terms of Use</a>. They apply to purchases made on the Jet Sites.
These Purchase Terms don’t apply to purchases made on third-party websites through our <strong>Jet Anywhere program.</strong></p><h3>Purchases Generally</h3><p>Only registered Jet Members using their own Jet membership accounts are authorized to make purchases on the Jet Sites.</p><p>The total price required for a purchase on the Jet Sites may depend on a number of factors that may change between the time you start adding items to your cart and the time you submit your purchase request. Items on the Jet Sites have a member price associated with each item. Additionally, savings amounts (“Jet Bonus Savings”) may be applied to the Member price(s) of the item(s) in your cart as you shop. For example, our system may lower or raise the Jet Bonus Savings applied to the item(s) in your cart, according to factors such as (i) the other items present in your cart, (ii) your shipping address, and (iii) your settings and preferences. The types of factors affecting prices may vary frequently. Accordingly, you must review your complete order, including any applicable Jet Bonus Savings (or any other savings amount), the final total purchase price and the final individual item prices, before you submit your purchase request.</p><p>Your submission of a purchase request is an offer by you to purchase the items selected at the prices indicated immediately prior to your submission of the request. This offer remains open until we email you to confirm that it has been accepted or that it has not been accepted (e.g., because an item has become unavailable).   Following acceptance, we will notify you of the identity of the seller(s) that will be selling and fulfilling your order. We cannot confirm the price of an item until after your order is placed. Pricing errors may occur on the Jet Sites. We reserve the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of the order confirmation mentioned above or a shipping notice. We may, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of the cancellation.</p><p>Jet does not currently accept coupons (other than those distributed by Jet).</p><h3>Taxes</h3><p>Items sold on the Jet Sites may be subject to tax. As on other e-commerce sites, prior to submitting your purchase request, you will see an estimate of the tax to be collected. The amount of tax charged on your order will depend on various factors, including the items purchased, the shipment destination, and the identity of the seller(s).

<p><h3>What is Jet?</h3></p>
<p>
    Jet is an e-commerce marketplace launching in early 2015.
    The company was founded by Marc Lore, founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://diapers.com" target="_blank">Diapers.com</a>,
    <a href="http://soap.com" target="_blank">Soap.com</a>,
    <a href="http://wag.com" target="_blank">Wag.com</a>
    and other Quidsi sites. Learn more about the company on Marc's
    <a href="http://marcericlore.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
</p>
<p><h3>Who are Jet Insiders and how do I become one?</h3></p>
<p>Jet Insiders are people who are excited about Jet's launch. Insiders get a free 6-month membership when they sign up with their email or join through Facebook. We want Jet Insiders to promote us by helping spread the news about Jet! By referring friends to become Jet Insiders, an Insider can move up the ranks and gain access to more Jet perks. Insiders must be 13 years or older and a U.S. resident or citizen, as well as meet the other requirements in the&nbsp;<a href="/insider/#/terms">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;to participate. Want to become a Jet Insider? Just sign up with your email&nbsp;<a href="#" data-ng-click="logout()">here</a>.</p>
<p><h3>What do I get as a Jet Insider and how do I move up the ranks?</h3></p>
<p> All Jet Insiders, you'll get a free 6-month membership to Jet.com once we launch. For each person that joins the program through your unique link, your rank will get a boost. And the higher you climb, the more Jet perks you unlock! <br><br>Here's what you get based on your final ranking:<br><br>Top 100,000 - Finish in the Top 100,000 Insiders and you'll earn pre-launch access to jet.com.<br><br>Top 10,000 - If you make it into our Top 10,000, we'll add on an extra 6 months to your membership, for a total of 1 free year. <br><br>Top 1,000 - Finish in our top thousand Insiders and we'll add to your 1-year membership, an additional 4-years of free Membership. Just imagine what you could do with five years of brilliant shopping!?<br><br>Top 100 - Finish in our top hundred Insiders and enjoy a free lifetime membership to the site. You might as well join Mensa!<br><br>Top 10 - If you're in the running to become a Top 10 Insider, you'll get to participate in an exciting Jet experience where you'll have access to additional materials and tools (including some non-public info) to help boost or hold on to your ranking. And you'll provide feedback so you can add more value to Jet. This includes access to our marketing team, marketing assets and the pre-launch site experience. To access these rank-boosting tools, you'll be required to agree to a consulting agreement with Jet. <br><br>If you finish in the Top 10, you'll earn 10,000 stock options to get Jet.com stock. <br><br>No.1 - Finish in this position and you will earn, on top of your lifetime membership and 10,000 stock options, an additional 90,000 Jet stock options, totaling 100,000. Remember that Jet Insider rankings move depending on how many other Insiders are successfully referring friends to the program. Again, please see the&nbsp;<a href="/insider/#/terms">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;for more details.</p>
<p><h3>What's up with these stock options?</h3></p>
<p>Jet insider stock options are the right to buy a specific number of shares of Jet.com common stock at a pre-determined price when the options become exercisable.  The pre-determined price—also known as the exercise price—is the fair market value of Jet.com stock as determined by Jet at the time of grant.<br><br>Jet offers options to service providers (including Jet employees) as equity compensation. If the value of Jet's stock increases over time, then the value of the Jet Insider stock options will also increase.   We are offering 100,000 stock options to our Top Insider.  The amount of this grant is on par with 4 year equity compensation packages received by some of our earliest and top-level employees.  We are also offering 10,000 stock options to our next nine Top Jet Insiders.   We are offering these stock options in exchange for the services you provide Jet as a Top 10 Insider.<br><br>Jet is not a public company and all Jet securities (including our stock options) are subject to federal and state securities law. Because of this, your ability to transfer Jet Insider stock options will be very limited. Also, you will not be able to exercise them until certain events occur, such as, for example, if Jet goes public or gets acquired someday. The exact terms of your stock options will be spelled out in detail in your stock option agreement (should you finish in the Top 10), and there is also more detailed information in the&nbsp;<a href="/insider/#/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p><h3>How do you recommend I share Jet Insider with friends?</h3></p>
<p>There's no right answer! You can email, Facebook, Tweet, or copy &amp; paste your unique link to share in any way you want. However you opt to share, be sure to tell folks that they get a free 6-month membership by signing up for Jet and that you increase your rank and can gain more Jet perks every time a friend signs up using your unique link.  We want everyone to know that you (and your friends) can benefit, so don't be shy about saying this is a promotion. Use the hashtag&nbsp;<span class="graphik-bold">#sharesforshares</span>&nbsp;to call this out.</p>
<p><h3>What does my Jet Insider rank mean?</h3></p>
<p>Your Jet Insider rank is a function of two things, your count of successful referrals to Jet Insider, and the time at which you first signed up for the program. The more friends you refer, the higher you will rank, and the more perks you will unlock. Remember that this program is dynamic, so your rank and perks may change regularly as other Jet Insiders sign up their friends. Continue referring friends throughout the program to maintain your rank and hold on to unlocked perks. The time stamp of your initial signup acts only as a tie-breaker between you and your fellow Insiders with the same number of successful referrals. While we'll do our best to give you the most accurate indication of your placement in the Jet Insider rankings via our website and emails, due to things like a high volume of referrals and,  the inclusion of unverified addresses all rankings are tentative until confirmed after the program ends.</p>
<p><h3>When does the Jet Insider program end?</h3></p>
<p>The Jet Insider program will end on&nbsp; <strong>February 6th, 2015, at 11:59 am ET</strong>. At this point, the Jet team will vet and finalize all rankings. We will move as quickly as we can, but need some time to review the results and make sure we get the rankings correct. So bear in mind that all ranks and perks are subject to change until confirmed. Jet reserves the right to disqualify any Jet Insider for anything that we determine to be "bad behavior" (violating our Terms of Service, circumventing the spirit of the Jet Insider Program, or otherwise acting inappropriately). We trust that you won't engage in any such bad behavior, but you must trust us to disqualify any Jet Insider that we believe is behaving badly!</p>
<p><h3>How can I connect with Jet?</h3></p>
<p>By signing up for Jet Insider, you've given us your email, which we'll use to keep in touch with you about the program and other Jet news. You can also reach us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:careers@jet.com">careers@jet.com</a>&nbsp;if you have interest in joining our team. For all other inquiries and requests, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@jet.com">info@jet.com</a>.<br><br>For more information about the Jet Insider program, please see our <a href="/insider/#/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p><h3>Who are Jet's investors?</h3></p>
<p>Jet raised a Series A round in 2014 from a number of trusted investors. In a round led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Accel Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and MentorTech Ventures, we raised $55M of funding. We secured an additional $20M of growth capital from Western Technology Investments (WTI) and a $5M asset-backed facility from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to bring our Series A round to a total of $80M. Read more about our Series A round&nbsp;<a href="http://marcericlore.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Look no further than our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tdfw730ckf98adu/AAAt-WJz8v6Nbc-KY1kF6eHea?dl=0" target="_blank">press kit</a>. Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:press@jet.com">press@jet.com</a>&nbsp;with additional inquiries.</p>
<p><h3>How do I remove my email from the Jet Insider list?</h3></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to be a part of the Insider program, simply email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:insider@jet.com">insider@jet.com</a>&nbsp;with your request to be removed.</p>

<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Last updated: December 4, 2014</p>
<p class="graphik-bold heading">By submitting a registration for the Jet Insider program, you agree to resolve any disputes with Jet through binding arbitration (and with very limited exceptions, not in court), and you waive certain rights to participate in class actions, as detailed <a href="#" data-ng-click="$event.preventDefault(); goToSection('#arbitration')">below</a>.</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Sponsor:</strong></u>&nbsp;Jet.com, Inc. ("<strong>Jet</strong>"). In these Rules, we refer to Jet as "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>Jet</strong>".
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Jet is a start-up company that is planning to launch in 2015. Jet plans on being a membership based e-commerce shopping experience that is like nothing you've seen before, and we will be available at www.jet.com (the "<strong>Site</strong>").</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Purpose of the Jet Insider Program (the "Program"):</strong></u>&nbsp;We want the Program to be a creative, fun way to promote Jet by asking you—potential future Jet Members—to help spread the word about Jet and, in exchange for promoting Jet, receive Jet Insider perks. We ask you to spread the word by social media (and maybe some other creative ways). To learn how, please check out the section entitled&nbsp;<strong>How to Promote as a Jet Insider.</strong>
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Eligibility to be a Jet Insider:</strong></u>&nbsp;Only eligible individuals can be Jet Insiders!  To be eligible to become a Jet Insider, you must:
</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet">Be an individual (e.g., not a corporation)</li>
    <li class="bullet">Be at least 13 years old</li>
    <li class="bullet">Be a resident or citizen of the United States or a territory of the United States</li>
    <li class="bullet">Not be a Jet employee</li>
    <li class="bullet">Not be a previously registered Jet Insider (see more rules about this below)</li>
</ul>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Further, in order to be eligible to receive the Jet Insider Perks (detailed below), you must adhere to these Terms of Service throughout the duration of the Program. Also, there are further eligibility requirements for receiving Jet Insider stock options - please see below. </p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>How to Register:</strong></u>&nbsp;Register by providing us with your email address, either via entering it into the email entry box or by authenticating via the Facebook Connect feature, and actively agreeing to these Terms of Service for the Program by clicking that you agree to these Terms of Service (prior to registering, you are able to review and disagree to these Terms of Service if you wish not to register).&nbsp;<strong>Please use an email address that you expect to monitor and keep throughout the duration of the Program and the rest of 2014 so that we can continue to contact you to claim your Jet perks.  We wouldn't want to lose you at some point!</strong>
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>How to move up the Jet Insider ranks:</strong></u>&nbsp;Here's how Jet Insider ranking works:
</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet">Once you register, you will receive a unique link that is specific to you and only you (we call that your "<strong>Unique Link</strong>"). This link will be available to you across the experience, in your welcome email and whenever you enter the Site via your entry email at www.jet.com.</li>
    <li class="bullet">You can then use your Unique Link to attract other people to also become Jet Insiders (if they meet our eligibility requirements!).</li>
    <li class="bullet">Each time a new eligible person uses your Unique Link to become a Jet Insider, your referral count increases.  Your rank is calculated based on your referral count relative to other Insiders.</li>
    <li class="bullet">You can only become a Jet Insider once!</li>
    <li class="bullet">But you can't, shouldn't and we hope you don't use or generate additional email addresses or fake people to earn referrals.  (Yes, we thought of that.)  First, that's not being truthful.  Second, you'll be disqualified.  Third, cheating isn't really fun.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Don't submit other people's email addresses to your registration page.  They have to do it themselves.</li>
    <li class="bullet">The Program is currently slated to end on&nbsp;<strong>February 6th, 2015, at 11:59 am ET&nbsp;</strong>(that's noon Eastern time—we're in New Jersey). Sorry, all cool things must come to an end...  However, please note that this could change.  We reserve the right to make the deadline sooner or extend it to later, in each case without notice to you.  At the deadline, the Program automatically ends, and you can't add to your Jet Insider rank in any way, shape or form.</li>
    <li class="bullet">After the Program ends, Jet will need some time to verify, finalize and confirm the results.  We will move as quickly as we can, but must reserve the right to review the results and make sure we get the rankings correct.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>How to Promote as a Jet Insider:</strong></u>&nbsp;Jet aims to bring more transparency to the e-commerce shopping experience, and we hope you'll soon see that we place a high value on being upfront with our members.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph"><strong>And, we want the same in return from you—it's important that you are transparent and upfront when you are spreading the word about the Program. This is a promotion, so don't be shy about it.</strong></p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Always tell your friends, followers and readers that they will benefit by registering on Jet—and that you can benefit also.   That means:</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet"><strong>When you share your Unique Link on Twitter, Facebook,&nbsp;</strong>or other social media, always use the hashtag&nbsp;<strong>#sharesforshares&nbsp;</strong>in the same post, near the link.</li>
    <li class="bullet">When you share your Unique Link anywhere else (for example, in email or on a blog), be sure to say something like&nbsp; <strong>"Sign up to get a free six month membership to Jet, and by doing so, my Jet Insider rank will improve also!"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Failure to comply with these rules may be grounds for disqualification. </p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Don't Spam or Email Bomb People:</strong></u>&nbsp;If you share your Unique Link by email, please only send emails to people that you know. Automated (auto) texting is also prohibited.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>What you can get - Jet Insider Perks:</strong></u>&nbsp;Jet will offer various perks to Jet Insiders.  Here are a few details about the perks we know we are offering:
</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet"><strong>Memberships to Jet.&nbsp;</strong>Every Jet Insider is eligible to receive a free 6-month membership when we launch. After the Program ends, Jet Insiders with qualifying rankings (e.g., Top 10,000, Top 1,000) will receive a free membership to Jet for a time period that corresponds with these ranking. The qualifying rankings and the time periods of the corresponding free memberships are set forth on the Site's FAQ. To claim this benefit, qualifying Jet Insiders will need to complete the membership registration process, which includes providing us with additional personal information and accepting Jet's Terms of Use (which is a separate legal agreement that we will post before we launch).  </li>
    <li class="bullet"><strong>Early Access.&nbsp;</strong>When the program ends, the top 100,000 qualifying Jet Insiders will also be eligible for "Early Access" to www.jet.com (remember, we haven't even launched yet!) and will be able to shop on Jet before the general public.  We are working hard to get to launch, but we don't know when that will be yet.  We also don't know how long Early Access will last, and reserve the right to make Early Access as short as we need to, and/or to admit qualifying Jet Insiders in stages. That said, we can't wait to let high performing Jet Insiders in before the general public!  To claim this perk, qualifying Jet Insiders must complete the membership registration process described in the above paragraph.</li>
    <li class="bullet"><strong>Jet Insider Stock Options.&nbsp;</strong>We want super high performing Jet Insiders—the top 10 Jet Insiders—to also receive the benefits of being a Jet common stock owner (through Jet Insider Stock Options).  There is a second phase of the Program designed to compete for this reward, as discussed below in the "Final Competition" section.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">If we add any other Perks during the Program, we'll be sure to let you know!</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Selection of Winners and Awarding of Jet Perks:</strong></u>&nbsp;Jet has complete authority to d-etermine the validity and eligibility of sign-ups, calculate rankings, determine winners, and award perks, all in its sole discretion.  The Jet Insider website may indicate your current ranking in the program and may indicate which perks you currently have unlocked.&nbsp;<strong>However, these automated indications are tentative, may contain errors or ineligible referrals, and are subject to confirmation by Jet.</strong>&nbsp;Also, your ranking and the locked or unlocked status of perks likely will change during the competition as your rank changes relative to the rank of others.  So, for example, if you are eligible for top perks (like Jet stock options) early in the competition, this benefit might become locked again if enough other competitors surpass your count of successful referrals.  Note that in the event of a tie in referral count, the Jet Insider who joined the Program earliest (as determined by the time stamp of their initial Program sign up) will be awarded the higher ranking.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Eligibility to receive Jet Insider Stock Options:</strong></u>&nbsp;Only eligible Jet Insiders can compete for Jet Insider Stock Options.  To be eligible, you must:
</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet">Qualify for the Final Group (as defined below) and take the steps required of all participants in the Final Group.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Be at least 18 years old. (If you're not 18 years old and have gotten this far, then you have a bright future in social media!  We will try to allow you to participate in the Final Group by allowing you to designate your parent or guardian as the potential recipient of the Jet Insider Stock Options.)</li>
    <li class="bullet">Must not be an "immediate relative" of a Jet employee. The words "immediate relative" include spouses, life partners, parents, and children.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Must not work on the Program through a company that Jet engages (for example, our lawyers who helped draft these terms are not eligible).</li>
    <li class="bullet">Agree to the Jet Insider consulting terms regarding confidentiality of certain information you receive in the Final Group, transferring to Jet the ownership of data-Jet-related intellectual property created by you in the Program and granting a license to you to use Jet assets as part of the Program.</li>
</ul><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Final Competition:</strong></u>&nbsp;The Final Group will compete for the Jet Insider Stock Options, and as part of this competition will be provided greater tools and access to Jet, with the focus on increasing their referral counts and ranking, creating better social media marketing for Jet (hey, we love your expertise!) and attracting more Jet Insider registrations for Jet. The Final Group will receive:
</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet">Jet training (you need to know Jet to promote Jet!)</li>
    <li class="bullet">Access to Jet's "beta" e-commerce site to review the Jet e-commerce shopping experience - you will give feedback before we are even launched</li>
    <li class="bullet">Jet Insider surveys that will help shape the Jet experience</li>
    <li class="bullet">Access to Jet's marketing team (we promise they are pretty cool people)</li>
    <li class="bullet">Enhanced Jet marketing materials that can improve your ability to attract new Jet Insiders</li>
    <li class="bullet">Use of the Jet Analytics dashboard to better understand your rank and how to increase it</li>
    <li class="bullet">Access to Jet public relations materials to keep you on the cutting edge of Jet's organization.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Please note that the final competition for Jet Insider stock options will require considerably more time and effort from Jet Insiders, which is why Jet is willing to compensate those top ranking Jet Insiders with Jet Insider Stock Options.  You will have helped promote Jet that much.</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>The Final Group:</strong></u>&nbsp;Part way through Program, Jet will start to determine the group of highest ranking Jet Insiders to compete for the Jet Insider Stock Options (the "<strong>Final Group</strong>"). Jet anticipates that it will initially select the 50 highest-ranking Jet Insiders to first be invited into the Final Group, but we will definitely add more Jet Insiders into the Final Group if they compete their way in by moving up the ranks!  Jet will determine the exact number of Jet Insiders in the Final Group and the timing of the multiple invitations into the Final Group at Jet's discretion based upon a number of factors, including the number of Jet Insiders and the number of referrals made.  In any event, the Final Group will not exceed 100.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Top 10 Winners Receive Jet Insider Stock Options:</strong></u>&nbsp;At the end of the Program, the top 10 Jet Insiders (who are eligible to receive Jet Insider Stock Options under the rules of the Program) will be granted the following awards:<br><br>
    <u>Top Prize:</u>&nbsp;The Jet Insider with the highest rank will receive 100,000 Jet Insider Stock Options<br>
    <u>Places 2 - 9:</u>&nbsp;The next 9 highest ranking Jet Insiders will each receive 10,000 Jet Insider Stock Options
</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">In order for you to claim your Jet Insider Stock Options (a "<strong>Stock Option Recipient</strong>"), a Stock Option Recipient will be required to:</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet">Sign the Jet Insider stock option agreement, which will be provided to you as part of the Jet Insider stock option package.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Agree to the terms of the Jet Incentive Stock Option Plan, which will be provided to you as part of this stock option package.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Submit tax documentation requested by Jet or otherwise required by applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">"<strong>Jet Insider Stock Options</strong>" are options to purchase common stock of Jet.com, Inc.  Jet Insider Stock Options are similar to "stock options" received by Jet employees, but with certain additional, strict guidelines relating to how these stock options can be exercised and when you can receive a potential benefit from these options.   To exercise the Jet Insider Stock Options (once they are exercisable), the Stock Option Recipient will need to pay the exercise price for such Jet Insider Stock Options (the price is set forth below under the section entitled Exercisability) - the same as Jet employees.</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Restrictions on Transferability of Jet Insider Stock Options:</strong></u>&nbsp; The Stock Option Recipient will not be able to sell, transfer or otherwise assign these stock options to anybody else, except by will or by the laws of descent where the terms of the Jet Insider Stock Options are binding upon the executors, administrators, successors and assigns thereof.<strong>&nbsp;This means that, except in highly limited circumstances, the Stock Option Recipient cannot transfer the Jet Insider Stock Options.</strong>
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Exercisability:</strong></u>&nbsp;Each Jet Insider Stock Option will be granted at an exercise price that is equal to the fair market value of a share of Jet common stock, which will be determined by Jet in its sole and absolute discretion at the time of approval of grant.  This is the same as Jet has been doing for it's own Jet employees.  Jet Insider Stock Options will only be exercisable upon certain, predetermined extraordinary events that are set forth in the Jet Insider stock option agreement (e.g., the acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. by a third party, an initial public offering of Jet's common stock).
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Jet Common Stock:</strong></u>&nbsp;Upon exercise of your Jet Insider Stock Options, the Jet common stock that is issued will still be subject to further transfer restrictions.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Jet Insider Stock Options Are Subject to Applicable Securities Laws:</strong></u>&nbsp;The Stock Option Recipient acknowledges that the Jet Insider Stock Options have not been registered with the SEC under the Securities Act, or with any securities regulatory agency administering any state securities laws, and that the acquisition of Jet Insider Stock Options is conditioned upon compliance with the Securities Act and all applicable state securities laws.  The Stock Option Recipient agrees to cooperate with Jet to ensure compliance with such laws. The Stock Option Recipient acknowledges that he or she may not transfer any shares of Jet Common Stock (after exercise of the Jet Insider Stock Options), unless they are registered under the Securities Act or qualified under applicable state securities laws or unless, in the opinion of Jet's counsel, exemptions from such registration and qualification requirements are available.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>No Liquidity or Market for Jet Securities:</strong></u>&nbsp;The Jet Insider Stock Options and the underlying Jet common stock will be illiquid securities.  Neither the Jet Insider Stock Options (nor the underlying Jet common stock) may be transferred unless registered under applicable federal and state securities laws or unless an exemption from such law is available (in addition to the other transfer restrictions described above).  Jet has no plans, and is under no obligation, to register the Jet Insider Stock Options or the underlying Jet common stock under the 1933 Act. No market exists for the Jet Insider Stock Options or the underlying Jet common stock and none is anticipated to develop.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Securities are of Speculative Value:</strong></u>&nbsp; Jet cannot determine the future value of Jet common stock.  When the Jet Insider Stock Options become exercisable, the exercise price of the Jet Insider Stock Options could be greater than the value of the underlying Jet common stock. In such case, the Jet Insider Stock Options would have no value.
</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph"><strong>The summary of the Program (including the Rules and the description of Jet Insider Stock Options) does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of Jet as to any person in any jurisdiction in which it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation.</strong></p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Competition Fraud, Rules Violations, Errors and the Challenging of Results:</strong></u>&nbsp; We encourage you to report suspected fraud, Rules violations or points/ranking calculation errors to us on a confidential basis at insider@jet.com.  We appreciate your help and reserve the right to investigate and act on such reports or to decline to do so in our sole discretion.  However, if we determine that you have challenged your ranking, the eligibility or ranking of another, or this Program, including by commencing or threatening arbitration or court action against us or any other person, you will forfeit all perks, and we will have no liability to you.  You agree not to engage in such challenges.  No yelling at the ref, please!  Let's keep this friendly.
</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Other Jet Insider Rules:</strong></u>&nbsp;We want the Program to be fun, but - as your parents may have warned you - even fun has its limits.  So we ask that when tweeting, posting or otherwise spreading the news about the Program (including your Unique Link), please keep it clean, fun and in good taste!  Jet also reserves the right to disqualify any Jet Insider or change the ranking earned by any Jet Insider, in Jet's sole discretion, for any reason, including but not limited to reasons of obscenity, defamation or invasion of privacy.
</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph"><strong>Jet Insider perks (including Jet Insider Stock Options) are subject to final verification that all Jet Insider registrations from your Unique Link are valid.</strong></p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Qualifying Jet Insiders will be notified of their ability to claim Jet Insider perks (including Jet Insider Stock Options) via an email sent to the email address used during registration.   If the Jet Insider fails to confirm acceptance of the Jet Insider perks and successfully complete any required registration or claim process within the deadline specified in the email (don't worry - we will give you at least one week notice!), the Jet Insider benefit will be deemed forfeited and shall not be awarded.   If a Jet Insider accepts the Jet Insider benefit, but does not use the benefit during the specified time frame (for example, "Early Access" won't last forever and any free Jet membership will with have an expiration period), then the Jet Insider benefit will be deemed forfeited.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Any and all taxes imposed on Jet Insider Perks are the sole responsibility of the Jet Insider (for Jet Insiders that receive stock options, there is more tax information in the Jet Insider Stock Options section).</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">If you no longer wish to be a part of the Program, email insider@jet.com with your request to be removed.  If you want to stop receiving Jet email solicitations either email insider@jet.com or you can click "unsubscribe" on an email that we send you.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Now that you've read the Rules about the Program, please also review the legal Rules for this program - these are also very important.</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Important Legal Stuff relating to the Program - Please read!</strong></u>
</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Jet Insiders are subject to all applicable laws and regulations.  The Program is void where prohibited by law.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph"><strong>By submitting a registration for the Program, you agree to resolve any disputes with Jet through binding arbitration (and with very limited exceptions, not in court), and you waive certain rights to participate in class actions, as detailed below.</strong></p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">No purchase is necessary to become a Jet Insider and receive the Jet Insider perks.  There is nothing to purchase to increase your odds of winning.  The odds of winning Jet Insider perks depend on how high your referral count and ranking is relative to other Jet Insiders and the total number of Jet Insiders that compete.  This is an open competition, not a random drawing, so there is no guarantee of any performance by you or any known odds of winning.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Also, our Jet lawyers tell us we must list out a lot of rules about what Jet Insiders cannot do.  These rules are important, so keep reading below.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph"><strong>But, to sum up the rules we list below, is easy: Jet reserves the right to disqualify any Jet Insider for anything that we determine to be "bad behavior" (violating these Rules, circumventing the spirit of the Program or these Rules, or otherwise acting inappropriately).  We trust that you won't engage in any such bad behavior, but you must trust us to disqualify any Jet Insider that we believe is behaving badly!</strong></p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">To be more specific, you must be truthful and accurate when registering and publicizing your Unique Link, and you will only score valid referrals when your Unique Link is used by ELIGIBLE persons that also become Jet Insiders.  Each and every Jet Insider (and each and every referral you earn) is subject to independent verification by Jet.  Jet reserves the right to deduct any number of successful referral credits from your personal total or disqualify you completely, in Jet's sole discretion, even if a Jet Insider joins using your Unique Link, for reasons such as:</p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet">Incomplete or untruthful registration.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Attempts to increase Jet Insider status through "dummy" email accounts.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Multiple attempts to register by the same person under different names or different email addresses.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Registering for people, even with their consent or at their request.  Each Jet Member must complete his or her own registration.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Any other violation of the Rules. </li>
</ul>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">And, all Jet Insiders must not do any of the following when using the Site or when participating in the Program: </p>
<ul class="graphik-light bullets">
    <li class="bullet">Access the Site using a third party's credentials or by concealing your true IP address. </li>
    <li class="bullet">Violate any applicable law or legal requirement.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Engage in conduct that is harmful to our interests or another user.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Display to others, mirror or frame the Site, or any individual element within the Site</li>
    <li class="bullet">Access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Site, Jet's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Jet or Jet's providers;</li>
    <li class="bullet">Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Site or breach any security or authentication measures;</li>
    <li class="bullet">Interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing the Site.</li>
    <li class="bullet">Avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, impair, descramble or otherwise circumvent any technological measure intended to protect, limit access to or control the Site;</li>

    <u><strong>Arbitration:</strong></u>&nbsp;Jet and you agree that these Rules affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Rules (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Site, any person's access to and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Site, Jet or you must give the other notice of the dispute, claim, or controversy, and the notice must include a brief written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, as well as the facts giving rise to the dispute, claim, or controversy and the relief requested.  You must send any such notice to Jet by email to <strong><a href="mailto:legal@jet.com">legal@jet.com</a></strong>&nbsp;AND by U.S. Mail to Jet.com, Inc., Attention: Jet Insider Legal Notice, 353 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair.  To the extent that Jet has your contact information, it will send any such notice to you by U.S. Mail and your email address.  Jet and you will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of dispute, claim, or controversy is sent.  Jet and you shall use reasonable, good faith, efforts to settle any dispute, claim, or controversy through consultation and good faith negotiations.  After 30 days, Jet or you may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice and 30 day negotiation period required by this paragraph shall not apply, however, to disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site. </p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind between Jet and you arising out of or relating to these Rules (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Site, any person's access to and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Site, if unresolved through informal discussions within thirty (30) days of the sending of the notice described above, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Newark New Jersey, and Jet and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in Newark, New Jersey to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. </p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Rules, and administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and fee information are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Jet shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.  You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless Jet is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.  For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees.  The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Jet and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Jet and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.  The arbitrator must follow these Rules and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney's fees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jet and you agree not to seek any attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless the arbitrator finds that a claim, defense or other fee- or cost-generating activity was asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or was frivolous.  Jet and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Jet and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  Jet and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. </p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">If you or Jet's claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules. </p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">You or Jet may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Jet otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Jet.com, Inc., Attention: Jet Insider Legal Notice, 353 Bloomfield Avenue, Montclair 07042.  The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of any of the Site, and if you have an account on the Site the notice must be sent from the email address we have on file for that account.  If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes, claims, or controversies in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.  If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Jet will not be bound by them either.  </p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">If any clause within this Disputes/Arbitration section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.  In any event, if for any reason a claim, dispute or controversy between Jet and you is before a court (e.g., if the arbitration provisions are found unenforceable or if pursuant to these Rules the matter is not subject to arbitration), Jet and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">This Disputes/Arbitration section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Jet, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Rules (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Site, any person's access to and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.</p><br>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">
    <u><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong></u>
</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph"><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">Jet and you agree that Jet and you will resolve any disputes, claims or controversies on an individual basis, and that any claims arising out of or relating to these Rules (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Site, any person's access to and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Site will be brought in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  Jet and you further agree that Jet and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to these Rules (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), the Site, any person's access to and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, products, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="graphik-light paragraph">This Class Action Waiver section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Jet, and to any claims asserted by any of them against you, to the extent that any such claims arise out of or relate to these Rules (such as with respect to their validity or enforceability), and/or the Site, and/or any person's access to and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.</p>
